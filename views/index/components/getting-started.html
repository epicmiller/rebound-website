    <h2 id="start">Awesome! How do I use it?</h2>
    <p>You can include Rebound on your page like this:</p>

<pre data-src="prism.js" class="line-numbers"><code class="language-markup">
&lt;script src="/javascripts/lib/rebound.runtime.js" id="Rebound"&gt;
{
  "root": "/",
  "globalComponents": {"chrome" : "nav"},
  "jsPath": "/javascripts/apps/:route/:app.js",
  "cssPath": "/stylesheets/apps/:app.css",
  "triggerOnFirstLoad": true,
  "routeMapping": {
    "": "home"
  }
}
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>

    <p>Because the Rebound script tag contains a src, nothing inside it gets executed, but is still accessable to the page as $('#Rebound').html().
       We take advantage of this to load Rebound's router config options right where you include the Rebound library itself. Convenient!
       Our <a href="/routing">routing section</a> covers exactly what these config options do.</p>

    <p><b>If no config is passed to Rebound inside of its script tag then Rebound's router will not start.
          This leaves you with a standalone data bound component library to integrate with as you see fit.</b></p>

    <p>Like Backbone, Rebound's only hard dependancy is a utility library, like <a href="www.underscorejs.org">Underscore</a> or <a href="https://lodash.com/">Lodash</a>. Rebound has no dependancy on JQuery, and shims JQuery's ajax method for RESTful persistance.</p>
