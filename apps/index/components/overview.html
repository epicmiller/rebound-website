    <h2 id="/">What is Rebound?</h2>
    <p>Rebound is a data-bound Model View Component framework built on <a href="http://www.backbonejs.org" target="_blank">Backbone</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tildeio/htmlbars" target="_blank">HTMLBars</a>.</p>
    <p>Rebound replaces Backbone's view layer with HTMLBars templates, binding your models to the dom on render and live updating your page as they change. </p>
    <p>To make the conversation two-way, event helpers and automatic bindings to form elements let you respond to user interaction. </p>
    <p>Combine this with an augmented, but still powerfully simple router and the new Web Components specification, and you get an amazingly small but powerful framework to develop data-bound single page apps.</p>
